<b>ActivityPub server on OpenBSD (snac)</b>
------------------------------------
<a href="https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2">snac</a> is a minimalistic ActivityPub instance written in portable C (from the repo description). I found it recently because I'm a big fan of federation, specifically the ActivityPub protocol, and I wanted to run my own instance because the instances I've used have felt a bit restrictive in their domain (note: this is not their fault, it's just because I have a wide range of topics I want to talk about that may not fit in a specific instance). I decided to spin up an instance for <a href="https://futurist.city">futurist.city</a>, hosted at <a href="https://futurist.pub">futurist.pub</a>. Anyways, below is a guide on how to do this for yourself on OpenBSD 7.3; The parts that pertain to OpenBSD will most likely stay the same, or very similar, however <b>snac is currently only on version 2.36, so some things are subject to change as time passes.</b>


<b>Prerequisites</b>
-------------
Before we get started, you need to have git, curl, and vim (optional) installed for this tutorial. You can add all of these by running

<i>pkg_add git curl vim</i>

After you've done this, it's time to put them to work.


<b>Cloning and installing</b>
----------------------
First, you need to clone the snac2 repository, preferrably into your root folder. Do this by running the following:

<i>git clone https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2.git</i>

This will create the folder snac2, which you need to cd into:

<i>cd snac2</i>

This is where you'll run the following commands to build the code and subsequently install them on the system.

<i>make</i>
<i>make install</i>

Now that it's installed, you need to edit the <i>examples/snac_openbsd</i> file:

<i>cd examples && vim snac_openbsd</i>

Below is what your file should look like:

<i>#!/bin/ksh

daemon_args="httpd /home/snac/snac-data"
daemon_logger="daemon.info"
daemon_user="snac"
daemon="/usr/local/bin/snac ${daemon_args}"

. /etc/rc.d/rc.subr

pexp="${daemon}.*"

rc_reload=NO
rc_bg=YES

rc_cmd $1

# this is an OpenBSD /etc/rc.d startup script. Edit and run as root:
#
# install snac_openbsd /etc/rc.d/snac
# rcctl enable snac
# rcctl start snac</i>

Just like the bottom of the file says, you need to install it and then enable it. <b>Do not start it yet.</b>

Add a user named snac to the system with the default options, and login to this account.

<i>adduser
...
login snac</i>

Once you've logged in, we need to cd into the snac user's directory and then initialize the snac folder.

<i>cd
snac init $HOME/snac-data</i>
	
Keep the address <b>127.0.0.1</b> and the port <b>8001</b>. Change the host to your domain, and add an admin email if you want.

Now start the snac daemon:

<i>rcctl start snac</i>

You've now successfully installed and initialized snac, but we've got a few steps before we can actually start using it - setting up httpd and relayd.


<b>Setting up httpd and relayd</b>
---------------------------
This is honestly the hardest part of all of this, but stick with me here. You need to get an ssl certificate, and you can do so by following <a href="https://romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/acme-client.html">this great tutorial</a> by Roman Zolotarev. Once you've done that, it's time to setup httpd. You can do so by copying (and editing) the following code into <i>/etc/httpd.conf</i>:

<i>server "example.com" {
	listen on * port 80

	location * {
		block return 301 "https://$HTTP_HOST$REQUEST_URI"
	}

	location "/.well-known/acme-challenge/*" {
		root "/acme"
		request strip 2
	}
}</i>

Now add the following to <i>/etc/relayd.conf</i>:

<i>timeout 90

log state changes
log connection errors

table &lt;httpd&gt; { 127.0.0.1 }
table &lt;snac&gt; { 127.0.0.1 }

http protocol httpfilter {
	tls ca cert "/etc/ssl/example.com.crt"
	tls keypair "example.com"
	
	return error

	match request header set "X-Forwarded-For" value "$REMOTE_ADDR"
	match request header set "X-Forwarded-By" value "$SERVER_ADDR:$SERVER_PORT"
	match request header set "X-Real-IP" value "$REMOTE_ADDR"
	match request header set "X-Forwarded-Proto" value "https"
	match request header set "Proxy" value ""

	match response header append "Strict-Transport-Security" value "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
	match response header append "X-Frame-Options" value "SAMEORIGIN"
    	match response header append "X-XSS-Protection" value "1; mode=block"
    	match response header append "X-Content-Type-Options" value "nosniff"
    	match response header append "Referrer-Policy" value "strict-origin"
    	match response header append "Content-Security-Policy" value "default-src https:; style-src 'self' \
      		'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self' data:; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'"
    	match response header append "Permissions-Policy" value "accelerometer=(none), camera=(none), \
      		geolocation=(none), gyroscope=(none), magnetometer=(none), microphone=(none), payment=(none), usb=(none)"

	tcp { nodelay, socket buffer 65536 }
	
	pass request quick header "Host" value "example.com" forward to &lt;httpd&gt;
	pass request quick header "Host" value "example.com" forward to &lt;snac&gt;
}

relay httpproxy {
	listen on 0.0.0.0 port 443 tls
	protocol httpfilter

	forward to &lt;snac&gt; port 8001
}</i>

You can view or download these files on sourcehut: <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jordanreger/futurist.city">git.sr.ht/~jordanreger/futurist.city</a>

This should cover everything. Please run the following to get started:

<i>rcctl start httpd && rcctl start relayd</i>

You may have issues with the certificate, and if so I did this to solve it:

<i>cp /etc/ssl/example.com.crt /etc/ssl/example.com.crt-bak
mv /etc/ssl/example.com.pem /etc/ssl/example.com.crt
rcctl restart relayd</i>


<b>Final steps</b>
-----------
To make snac useful, run:

<i>snac adduser $HOME/snac-data
...</i>

This will provide you with a link to your user account and a password to login. This will allow you to continue setting up your account with snac. You are now a host of the fediverse!
