I [ride bikes](/bikes), watch weather, make coffee, write code, and take photos.

## Bikes
I currently ride a 2019 Trek Marlin 6 hardtail daily. As a 3x8 drivetrain it may be out of date but it has disc brakes, which are an essential for me.

## Weather
I am a trained SKYWARN storm spotter. I have been one since early 2022, and plan on finishing the rest of my degree in Ohio State's atmospheric science department.

## Coffee
I am a barista and a self-made coffee critic (this is a joke). My favorite coffee overall is Stumptown Holler Mountain, brewed with an Aeropress using [James Hoffman's method](https://youtu.be/j6VlT_jUVPc?si=lnts2JtSifNClmAl).

## Code
I used to be a software engineer in training. I hate the industry and going to school for it completely destroyed my love for it, so I've let it sit on the backburner. I still write code for fun, which I think I'll do for the rest of my life.

## Photography
I also used to do freelance photo/video with my Sony a6000. I have since sold it and now use an iPhone 15 Pro. It is extremely nice and produces way better media than my Sony could (I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate for that). I will eventually post my images here, but for now they're on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/jordanreger).
