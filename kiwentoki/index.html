	<p>This is an idea I've had for a little bit to learn languages easier. It involves taking a reference language, in this case toki pona, a target language (see below), and comparing them. The beauty of toki pona is that you can communicate complex ideas with very simple base words; however, you can do the same in <i>any language</i>. For example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>toki pona: telo seli pimeja</li>
		<li>Swedish: varmt svart vatten</li>
		<li>Japanese: 熱い黒湯 (atsui kuro yu)</li>
		<li>Korean: 뜨거운 검은 물 (tteugeoun geom-eun mul)</li>
		<li>Croatian: vruća crna voda</li>
		<li>Dutch: heet zwart water</li>
		<li>Spanish: agua negra caliente</li>
		<li>Hindi: गरम काला पानी</li>
		<li>English: hot black water</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These statements are all pretty vague, but the point is that all of these words are simple descriptors that when strung together describe a more complex idea... coffee, in this case. The point of learning this way is not only to make it easier to learn languages by condensing them, but to make it way easier to learn by talking. If someone asked you for hot black water, <i>especially at a coffee shop</i>, chances are you'd understand what they're talking about. I'd also help them out by giving them the word: coffee. Xiaomanyc has a great video about how this works: "<a href="https://youtu.be/r3wiEHX8QdU">How I Learn Any Language in 24 Hours</a>". This helps you expand your knowledge of the language. What if you want tea? Hot black <i>leaf</i> water. "Oh, you're talking about tea." Congrats! You learned a new word.</p>
	<p>I think by having a solid foundation to describe pretty much anything, you can learn any language extremely easy. After all, this is how children learn. I hope to prove this works by using it myself.</p>
	<h2>Languages</h2>
	<p>Below is a list of the languages supported so far. Each may take some time to become complete. This is because as I use them, I will be editing them to make sure it contains everything necessary to get started in each language.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/kiwentoki/english.html">English</a></li>
		<li><a href="/kiwentoki/dutch.html">Dutch</a> (incomplete)</li>
		<li><a href="/kiwentoki/swedish.html">Swedish</a> (incomplete)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Roadmap</h2>
	<p>After the basic lists are complete for each language, I plan on making a searchable dictionary that encompasses each one.</p>
