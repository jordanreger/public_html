<h1 class="title">Email is easy, except not really</h1>
<p class="date">2023-06-15</p>

<p>I recently set up <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd">smtpd</a> for futurist.city following <a href="https://blog.obtusenet.com/byoes-build-your-own-email-server">this tutorial</a>, and it was super easy! In fact, it was so much easier than I thought. Email has always been a daunting task in my mind, and I was afraid it would always be that way. But, sure enough, I got it set up in around an hour. Except wait, I can&#x2019;t send emails externally? But I can receive external emails? This is weird. Okay, maybe there&#x2019;s something else going on. As with most of what I&#x2019;ve learned about OpenBSD recently, I headed to the IRC chat. I figure out that the VPS host blocks the SMTP port by default, and you have to fill out a form to get it unblocked. I do so, and shortly after the port is unblocked. I&#x2019;m excited, so I try to send another email and it sends, but I can&#x2019;t see it? Okay, apparently iCloud is refusing the connection. Gmail actually does receive it, except it sends it straight to spam? Okay, I&#x2019;ll enable all of the spam protection, and use SPF and DKIM. I try again. Same result. Weird&#x2026; I go to the IRC chat again: &#x201C;oh yeah that&#x2019;s just how email is, don&#x2019;t take it personally&#x201D;</p>
