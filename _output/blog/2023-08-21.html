<p>I often forget that I&#x2019;m a normal person. I don&#x2019;t feel like a &#x201C;main character&#x201D; but I do often forget that most things don&#x2019;t affect me and I shouldn&#x2019;t worry about them. Things as big as climate change, social issues, and other things that are almost completely out of my hands.</p>
<p>I also worry about becoming this superstar X (fill in the blank), largely because the majority of past Jordans thought they could do anything. I don&#x2019;t blame anyone for this, it was just simply my lack of failure. A lot was very easy for me as a kid, and if it wasn&#x2019;t, I did it as little as possible. Once again, I don&#x2019;t blame anyone for this - I was a kid.</p>
<p>Recently I&#x2019;ve been thinking about the future of my career. I&#x2019;m still in school, quite close to being done, but it has led me to mostly dislike software engineering as a whole. The industry is a mess and I want to apply it to something good. However, I&#x2019;ve also realized these two things:</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s okay to not be specialized. In fact, I doubt I could ever become specialized because I am interested in learning so many different things. It&#x2019;s okay to work at a grocery store or coffee shop as an adult, because we need those jobs filled.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s time to suck it up. Nothing is perfect, so stopping to complain about it is not okay. You can most certainly implement change by not participating, but there&#x2019;s only so much one person can do. In that case, either tell other people to change it with you or just accept it (in this instance I&#x2019;m talking about the software industry specifically).</p>
<p>Anyways, I still feel a drive to do the right thing but I&#x2019;ve realized that my part is only human-sized, and I don&#x2019;t need to worry much about it.</p>
