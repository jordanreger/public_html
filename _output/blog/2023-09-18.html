<h1 class="title">Why I like Go more than any other language</h1>

<p>Go is not really a popular language, simply because a lot of people look to languages like Rust, Zig, or TypeScript for their project or learning. I don&#x2019;t blame them; they&#x2019;re popular for a reason. As my last blog post described, I love Rust after working with it for just a week. I think that&#x2019;s amazing! There&#x2019;s something way more fascinating about Go though, and that is that it is not flashy whatsoever. It&#x2019;s not the hottest language. It doesn&#x2019;t have any &#x201C;blazingly fast&#x201D; features (except the concurrency model, but we&#x2019;ll discard that for sake of discussion). It just gets the job done as quick and simply as possible. I value code readability more than anything really - this has gotten me into a lot of arguments - because in my opinion, code is a form of a story. A story guided by strict logic. If you can&#x2019;t follow the story easily, it is a bad story (it may still have one, but is not good).</p>
<p>Go is often compared to Python, which I think is an oversimplification. Maybe it&#x2019;s because I learned to program in Python but I will probably never use it again - it is a nightmare to use now because of the web of dependencies, the weird transition from Python 2 to Python 3, and above all - it&#x2019;s just so complicated for a seemingly simple language. Most people hate it for the formatting, but that is very low on my list. It feels like node_modules as a language. Go is only similar in a few ways to Python, and none of those actually matter (basically just the lack of semicolons). Go is a systems (and, I&#x2019;d argue web-forward) language that is closer to C than Python. After all, Ken Thompson and Rob Pike helped design it.</p>
<p>To me it feels like the only language with intentional design from the start. I am a big fan of the UNIX philosophy and minimalism and I believe Go is the only language that truly embodies the UNIX philosophy. Very much like the game of Go, it is not complicated yet it can scale into a massive, unique creation using it&#x2019;s simple parts. The fact that I wrote the same amount of code in Go in about 1/8 the time it took to write Rust should say quite a lot about the simplicity of it all. I may enjoy learning programming languages but I have found my lifelong friend, the language I will write most things in: Go.</p>
