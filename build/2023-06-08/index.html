<h1>Simplicity and Culture</h1>
<p>2023-06-08</p>
<p>I am a simple person.</p>
<p>I enjoy the complexities of technological innovation and our society because they're undoubtedly impressive, but I also feel a very strong resistance to it. I (mostly) don't appreciate material things and I don't like American culture in almost every way. The announcement of Apple's Vision Pro headset has made me fully realize how torn I am; I love the design and the idea, but it seems like it has the potential to make our mental health/societal problems collectively worse. I'm a sucker for cyberpunk media (and, for the sake of this post, especially Ready Player One) but I also know just how bad it would be for humanity if any of those universes were to be (more) real.</p>
<p>I've recently started learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture">permaculture</a> and <a href="http://viznut.fi/texts-en/permacomputing.html">permacomputing</a> and I'm excited to learn more. One of the scariest things about the problems we face as a species are the people who are potentially (and maliciously) leading us in the wrong direction. Permaculture/computing is extremely fascinating to me because I think they're the perfect blend of simplicity and complexity. I think that to solve the climate and energy crises that are hurtling towards us (and <a href="https://neuters.de/business/environment/us-states-under-air-quality-alerts-canadian-smoke-drifts-south-2023-06-07/">in some ways are already occurring</a>) a drastic change is needed and permaculture/computing can provide a framework for how we can transition everything else to a more sustainable and human-friendly future.</p>
<p>The random launch into conversation about the impending dystopia is a normal thing for me, so you'll have to excuse it, but I think it's important to keep myself grounded in this way. Anyways, I try to live simply because of this and I think a lot of people could benefit from doing the same - a lot of things are way more simple than they seem, or at least they should be. I think about this often and consequentially have simplified practically everything in my life. This is the opposite of the culture I live in and frankly I hate it. I feel the same way that Drew Devault does in <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/06/07/The-Netherlands.html">his post about moving to the Netherlands</a> where he says "leaving the US is a selfish choice." I'm sure I could stay here and make change happen but it feels more damaging to stay here fighting for what's right than it does to do the same somewhere less... bad, for a lack of a better word. To be honest, I'm not really sure how to navigate the future because of this and that has wrecked a lot of decisions for me. I'm glad to be where I'm at now but it is difficult to realize that I've given up a traditionally attractive lifestyle (or rather, what would be) for my morals.</p>
<p>If only things were simpler...</p>
