	<p>I just released the second version of my writing tool, pub. You can probably tell if you're subscribed to my mailing list due to the accidental "test" email I sent out while debugging. It is still a personal tool, but it's gotten a lot easier for me to write. For example, this post is just a text file that I pass in via the --file flag. You can check out the source code at the same repository: <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jordanreger/pub">git.sr.ht/~jordanreger/pub</a>

	One thing you may notice is that it's written in JavaScript... Why did I go backwards? Well, I'll explain why I still love JavaScript in a future post, but for now I'll give a brief rundown on why I chose it: it's easy to write, and with tools like <a href="https://bellard.org/quickjs/">QuickJS</a> it makes running and building it *everywhere* just as easy. Don't get me wrong, I love learning new programming languages and figuring out what they're best at, but I think JavaScript covers 99.99% of the tasks I need to accomplish. All-in-all, it's just as fast as any other program I've written, and it does the job just as well. The difference is that I wrote 99.99% (okay, probably less than that) from memory. Regardless, I'm still a fan of JavaScript and I don't think we'll get away from it anytime soon.
