	<h1>Vim to Helix</h1>

	<p>I switched to <a href="https://helix-editor.com">Helix Editor</a> from Vim a few days ago and I can already tell I'm going to stick with it for a very long time. I've used Vim for a few months now, learning the motions, how to customize it, how to make it <i>my</i> editor and it's been great, don't get me wrong. I will forever appreciate Vim and the things it's taught me, on top of that list is how to use my keyboard effectively. I'd say it's a must-learn for any computer user. One of the only things I dislike about it (and especially Neovim) is the customization... It's not hard by any means, it's just needlessly complicated in my opinion. Lua is actually quite a fun language but I think it's bad as a configuration file. What Helix uses, TOML, makes much more sense and allows for way quicker, cleaner, and simpler configuration (to be clear: Vim's configs are a lot easier than in-depth VSCode configs, so I'll give it that credit). You can view my Helix configs <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jordanreger/dotfiles/tree/main/item/helix">here</a>. This is <i>way</i> easier than just setting up <a href="https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig#suggested-configuration">nvim-lspconfig</a>. That's crazy! The best part about Helix, though, is not just the customization. It's that most motions in Vim are transferred over to Helix. The only one I've found that's noticeably different is <kbd>x</kbd> (and <kbd>d</kbd>). <kbd>x</kbd> in Vim deletes characters, but <kbd>d</kbd> in Helix does that - <kbd>x</kbd> in Helix selects the current line in total. This is actually way easier in my opinion, as most of the time I'm deleting full lines so hitting <kbd>x</kbd> and then <kbd>d</kbd> does that way quicker than <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> and then <kbd>d</kbd>; Vim's <kbd>dd</kbd> works just as well but I feel like having a single character to select a line is nicer. My workflow is largely the same and I spend *way* less time (already) on customizing and way more on coding. That's what's most important, after all. I encourage you to give Helix a try if you're a minimalist Vim user. <b>Edit 1</b>: the file viewer and pretty much everything else about the <kbd>space</kbd> menu is <i>so</i> nice. I'm serious, it's almost worth it just for the file viewer.</p>
