	<h1>First week with Rust</h1>
	<time>2023-08-30</time>
<p>I've been putting off learning Rust for a while, simply because I thought it was too difficult. Recently, though, I've fallen in love with it and have written it every single day for the past week or so. I started by making <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jordanreger/fold.rs"><code>fold(1)</code></a> again, rewriting the <a href="https://sr.ht/~jordanreger/nws">NWS Tornado bot and added a Severe Tstorm bot</a>, and now I'm working on an <a href="https://sr.ht/~jordanreger/atproto_api">ATProto API</a>. This is only the first week! I feel more productive than ever, and I'm actually having fun doing it.</p>
<p>One of the things I like so much about it is that it holds your hand if you really need it (like me), but as you learn you need it less and less. As soon as I learned about the <code>Option</code> type, I basically never had an issue with it again. The errors are insightful and extremely helpful - very rarely do I feel lost, like with some other languages. The best part about it is that it feels simpler than JavaScript and way safer than TypeScript. I may not be able to whip up a simple project in the same amount of time as JavaScript but doing so regardless helps me learn new things, especially things I've never had to touch because of my time spent in JavaScript.</p>
<p>There'll probably be a blog post sooner than later that talks about simplicity vs ease and I'll probably come back to this topic because, if I'm honest, Rust is neither simple or easy - however I think that's for good. Regardless, I think if you haven't already, take a week or so to learn Rust. It's a fascinating language and gets a lot of things right.</p>
