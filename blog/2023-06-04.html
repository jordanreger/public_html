	<p>Good morning - I think I may make this my permanent home on the web. It fits what I need very well, and I feel like it has potential to be useful to other people as well. As I've mentioned before I really want to make it so I can do pretty much everything from here, such as mail, smallweb dev, file management, etc. I've always known that I don't need much in my life but more recently that's expanded to software as well. I don't want to get too far into it, but I've realized that I don't think I'm cut out as a traditional software engineer. My love for software stems from the creativity and novelty of using software to solve new or important things; I don't think that I can really do that in a professional setting today. I've been interested in going back to school (after I finish this degree...) for atmospheric science/meteorology. I would love to do this; I still have basically 3 years before my peers catch up with me chronologically when it comes to school (meaning I've been in college for 3 years while they just started this year). Obviously this isn't important in the long run but from my perspective now it helps me to frame just how much time I have to do this kind of stuff. There's a lot more for another day, but for now I'll leave it there.</p>
