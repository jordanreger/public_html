	<p>This is a pre-results post simply to mark the date in history, regardless of whether or not it's real. I am both nervous and excited for the results, yet for the past few days I've been reminding myself of the very probable answer that it's not real. What's most exciting of all of this, though, is the gold rush mentality that the whole STEM community is currently experiencing. Even if this potentially world-changing material isn't real, I don't feel as if I've wasted time - this is why I fell in love with STEM in the first place and it's nice to be reminded of it. Also, I was going to write about the Web Environment Integrity proposal and as I was doing so I was scrolling through Hacker News and a link to the paper caught my eye. I immediately stopped writing and fell down this rabbit t holle; I haven't come back up since. All there is left to say is<br>
