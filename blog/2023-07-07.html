	<p>Introducing pub, my new writing tool! I built it by hand in shell script, specifically using ksh. It allows me to write blog posts in the terminal and propagate the posts to text, html, and email. The coolest part about it is that it feels like I'm just writing an email using the mail(1) command. It also auto-wraps the content for nex (60 lines) and email (80 - however this may change to 72 as per <a href="https://useplaintext.email">useplaintext.email</a>). It also automatically moves them to their corresponding directories, so I don't even have to move them myself. You can check it out on Sourcehut by visiting:<br>
